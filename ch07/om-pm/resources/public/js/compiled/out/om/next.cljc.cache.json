Note this means the callback can be invoked\n                     multiple times to support parallel fetching and incremental\n                     loading if desired. The callback should take the response as the\n                     first argument and the the query that was sent as the second\n                     argument.\n     :normalize    - whether the state should be normalized.

Defaults to [:remote]\n     :root-render  - the root render function. Defaults to ReactDOM.render\n     :root-unmount - the root unmount function. Defaults to\n                     ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode\n     :logger       - supply a goog.log compatible logger\n     :tx-listen    - a function of 2 arguments that will listen to transactions.\n                     The first argument is the parser's env map also containing\n                     the old and new state. The second argument is a map containing\n                     the transaction, its result and the remote sends that the\n                     transaction originated."],"~$*instrument*",["^ ","^1>",["^
